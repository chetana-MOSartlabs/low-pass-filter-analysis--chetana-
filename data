## Explanation of Data and Graphs
  
The tables record measurements from the frequency response analysis of an RC low-pass filter. For each input sine wave frequency, the input voltage and corresponding output voltage across the filter were measured. Using these values, the gain in decibels (dB) was calculated using the formula:
