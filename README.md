# low-pass-filter-analysis--chetana-
Analysis of an RC low-pass filterâ€™s frequency response using WaveForms and Excel. Includes data tables, gain calculations in dB, and plots with logarithmic frequency axis. Demonstrates measurement, data processing, and GitHub version control with clear documentation.

# Assignment Objectives
To analyze the frequency response of an RC low-pass filter by generating sine waves at multiple frequencies, measuring input and output voltages, calculating gain, and plotting gain versus frequency with a logarithmic scale.

# Steps Taken
1.Used WaveForms Wavegen to generate sine waves at specific frequencies.

2.Measured input and output voltages using WaveForms Scope.

3.Calculated gain in decibels (dB) for each frequency.

4.Plotted Gain (dB) vs Frequency (Hz) with a logarithmic frequency axis in Excel.

5.Documented observations and organized all data, images, and scripts.

6.Created this GitHub repository with proper directory structure and version control.

# Key Observations and Outcomes
->The RC low-pass filter allows low-frequency signals to pass with minimal attenuation.

->Gain decreases as frequency increases, showing expected filter roll-off behavior.

->The results validate the theoretical characteristics of the RC low-pass filter.
